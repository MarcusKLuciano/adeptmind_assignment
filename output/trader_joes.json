We find that it\u2019s especially suited, however, for shredding and sprinkling over and into other savory dishes and snacks. Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla. Just be sure to seek out this Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar before it\u2019s too late, because supplies are limited.

For those looking for a ready- for-the-grill burger with a uniquely flavorful twist, you\u2019ll want to try Trader Joe\u2019s Angus C.B.P. Ground Beef 1/3 lb. Patties.This is a Ground blend of three different whole-muscle cuts of Angus beef. Angus refers to the more muscular Aberdeen Angus cattle breed, which yields meat with plenty of fat marbling. This marbling translates into juicy, tender meat. More specifically, this C.B.P. blend incorporates Angus cuts from the shoulder (Chuck), chest (Brisket), and rump (Picanha). The Brisket (20% of the blend) and Picanha (5%) each contribute amazingly rich flavor, with their slightly fattier composition, while the leaner and more conventional ground Chuck (75%) brings additional \u2018beefiness\u2019 and balance.All of this amounts to a Ground Beef blend that is about 75% lean/25% fat\u2014ideal for quick, hot grilling. And the substantial size of these pre-portioned 1/3 lb. Patties allows them to remain tender & juicy, even when cooked over the flames. The resulting bigger burgers will also easily fill TJ\u2019s Brioche Buns to satisfy even the hungriest BBQ-goers\u2014but only for a limited time.

After this, they\u2019re heated, which causes a curious reaction where the frozen water within the berries instantly transitions to a vapor, skipping the liquid phase entirely. And since raspberries are mostly water, what remains of each raspberry is super concentrated with their signature, sweet-tart flavor\u2013in fact, it takes more than a half a pound of fresh raspberries to make each 1.2-ounce pouch of our Freeze Dried Raspberries.But you didn\u2019t come here for a science lesson\u2014you came here because you love sweet, crisp, fruity snacks!

This thought led us to entertain the idea of a cookie assortment for the warmer months... which led us to one of our long-time cookie suppliers in Belgium... which led to the creation of Trader Joe\u2019s Belgian Cookie Assortment!The package contains two sealed trays to help maintain cookie crispness, in case the group you\u2019re entertaining isn\u2019t large enough to eat a whole box of 42 Cookies. Each tray includes three different types of Cookies, all made using a traditional, all-butter recipe. There are Lemon Flavored Waffle Cookies with a bright flavor and satisfying texture. There are classic Butter Almond Thins (the very same Cookies we\u2019ve been selling every day since 2004) that are thin and crisp, with scattered slices of almond. This Assortment also includes a variation on the Butter Almond Thins that not only contain sliced almonds, but also Strawberry Flavored Bits made with fruit juices and pur\u00e9es.Trader Joe\u2019s Belgian Cookie Assortment can be easily plated and promptly presented for a nearly no-effort dessert that will patently please all the people you\u2019ve gathered. And just in case you\u2019re not feeling quite up to a party, it\u2019s totally okay if these Cookies entertain an audience of one!", "sale_prices": 4.99, "prices": [4.99, 4.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/76090.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/76090.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/76090.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/76090.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/belgian-cookie-assortment-076090", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "076090", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/76090.png", "size": 7.76, "unit": "Oz", "price": 4.99}]}, {"product_id": "056333", "title": "Joe's Dark Ground Coffee", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m304/56333.png", "price": 4.99, "currency": "USD", "description": "The simple act of brewing a cup of morning coffee can provide a moment of culinary Zen\u2014a quiet and creative start to one\u2019s day, before the flurry of mundane and required tasks kick in.

The solution to the soggy mess situation was panko bread crumbs, lightly seasoned with garlic butter flavor. This simple breading creates a crispy crust that brings a captivating crunch to every bite.

But, in an unexpected turnover, the chicken wing has intercepted the top spot for beloved bar nosh and ubiquitous sports-watching snacks. Now, Trader Joe\u2019s brings our own version of wings to the table (or bar top). Our new Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings have a list of stats that will make it hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to catch a game without wanting them close-at-hand.Here\u2019s what makes our Wings soar above local pub grub: First, they come from vegetarian chickens. That means our California-grown birds are raised on a balanced diet of corn and soybean meal. They are never fed animal fat or animal by-products. Second, our Wings are 100% antibiotic-free (ABF). This is especially notable, since Trader Joe\u2019s is currently the only retailer selling completely ABF, hot and spicy wings. Third, our Wings are super easy to prepare. They\u2019ve been fully cooked and promptly frozen. This means they\u2019re ready to heat at a moment\u2019s notice, in the microwave or conventional oven.Like the original Buffalo wings, ours are \u201csectioned\u201d (cut in half), and covered in a spicy sauce made from vinegar, cayenne peppers, and chile pepper extract. These bite- (or three) sized snacks are the perfect finger- food. Spray canola oil on your baking tray for extra-crispy wings. And, be sure to have some cool dip at the ready.

Xiao Long Bao are essentially soup dumplings, but instead of dumplings that go in the soup (though you can still certainly make this happen), the soup actually goes inside these dumplings.

Once the soup is wrapped in the dough and sealed (Bao means \u201cwrapped\u201d in Chinese), it is steamed until fully cooked (Xiao Long refers to a traditional Chinese bamboo steamer). Lastly, our dumplings are put into microwave-safe packages and frozen so we can deliver them to you.To enjoy, you simply cut the corner of the bag and microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Let your Dumplings sit for at least another minute before removing from microwave. The insides will be very hot, so be careful!

We toss in some diced celery and green onions for good measure (and some added crunch), then add the finishing touches, like sea salt, parsley, white wine vinegar, and a pinch of black pepper. While Trader Joe\u2019s Egg Salad is certainly delightful on its own, it truly sings as part of an egg salad sandwich.

To salvage her extra- caramelized endeavor, she placed a layer of pastry over the apples, popped the whole pan in the oven, and served the resulting dessert upside-down. Her guests loved this accidental apple pie-alternative so much that it became a fixture on the menu and, ultimately, rose to prominence all over France.Accident or no accident, however, making a modern-day Apple Tatin from scratch is actually quite a tricky and time-consuming endeavor.

In fact, it\u2019s a strong, dark, Belgian-style Ale that\u2019s great when it\u2019s fresh, and even better when allowed to mature for months\u2014or even years. The renowned Canadian brewery that made it for us bottles it with fresh yeast, so that the Ale will undergo a second fermentation process. Over time, the yeast will continue to consume sugar, producing more alcohol and carbon dioxide (bubbles!), ultimately yielding an increasingly rich and complex flavor profile of cocoa, citrus, ginger, and other baking spices.Now, this second fermentation takes place over time, which is why it\u2019s perfectly acceptable\u2014perhaps even preferable\u2014to \u201cage\u201d this beer.

Second, we\u2019ve gone ahead and Brined the Breast for you, with a seasoning mix that includes salt, sugar, white pepper, and garlic & onion powders. Aside from the flavor benefits of this marinade, brining helps keep the meat moist and tender through the cooking process. Using salt to keep moisture in might seem a little counter-intuitive, but there\u2019s some real science to it: Typically, as proteins cook, the muscle fibers shrink, which squeezes out moisture. Salt slows down this squeezing process, allowing muscle fibers to absorb the moisture instead, creating juicier, more flavorful results.And speaking of flavor, since these Breasts are Bone-In, they retain even more moisture while cooking, which complements all the taste-benefits the brining brings. Consequently, they need only minimal seasoning, if any, prior to cooking.

The sheets are then rolled into a long cylinder, creating dozens of thin layers. Finally, the cylinder is cut into discs that are each gently hand-pressed into a wide, conical shape.

And when carefully balanced into a single spice blend, as they are in Trader Joe\u2019s Smoky & Hot Chile Powder, they create a highly versatile seasoning that brings a smoky, savory kick to dishes of all kinds.Made with just the right ratio of smoked paprika and chile powder to create just the right ratio of smoke to heat, our Smoky & Hot Chile Powder is super handy for making savory soups, sauces, and stews, and nearly indispensable when creating homemade BBQ rubs and Cajun-style seasonings. It adds a remarkable depth of flavor when sprinkled over scrambled eggs, roasted veggies, or grilled seafood, and can take snack foods like popcorn and potato chips into an entirely new dimension.

The additional maturation of this specific Le Gruy\u00e8re is a key to the final taste and texture.

When it comes to Trader Joe\u2019s holiday products, part of our tradition is to partner with producers who have plenty of experience in making whatever it is they make. For example, we found some candy cane crafters who have been in the business for one hundred years. With just one lick of a Trader Joe\u2019s Handmade Candy Cane, you can tell that tradition is hard at work!Ironically, their deep candy tradition has produced for us a very unique\u2014one might even say, untraditional Candy Cane. Unlike mass market-produced candy canes that are concocted with high-fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors, our red-and-white-striped Candy Canes are made with peppermint oil, tapioca syrup, and colors derived from red radish. They are hand-pulled, which gives them a beautiful sheen, and they\u2019re generously sized (read: big!). Perhaps the most decidedly untraditional aspect of Trader Joe\u2019s Handmade Candy Canes is the fact that after a bunch of licks, you\u2019ll encounter a soft, Cocoa Cr\u00e8me filling. Yum!These Handmade Candy Canes make wonderful stocking stuffers, and they are also pretty impressive when included as part of a holiday gift basket.

Herbes de Provence [ERB-duh-proh-VAHNS] is a mixture of herbs typical of the Provence region in the south of France. It wasn\u2019t commercially available as a ready-to-use blend under that name until the 1970\u2019s, and the specific herbs used in the blend can vary, as cooks choose different herbs to suit their taste. The blend in this jar, created exclusively for us in Florida, is comprised of thyme, marjoram, savory, rosemary, basil, sage and lavender, creating a savory, aromatic seasoning that can be used in a multitude of preparations.So how, and when, can you use Herbes de Provence? It is usually added before or during cooking, often when oil is heating, which helps to draw out the aromatics and allow them to meld into the recipe. It lends a sense of elegance when roasted with vegetables, and provides a floral balance to savory roasted poultry or fish.

We've taken traditional hot cocoa mix - you know, one that's rich and creamy and sweet and incredibly delicious in every way - and added natural caramel flavor, so that every sip delivers the enhanced richness and sweetness of caramel. But we didn't stop there. Nope. We went all the way in, adding salt to the caramel flavor, so that the final result, when mixed with hot water or milk, is the warm, liquid manifestation of our ever-popular Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Caramels. A single sip simply wouldn't suffice, so a single scoop makes a nice-sized mug of salty, caramely, chocolately deliciousness.

We like to engage in all discourse around baking, especially when it comes to chocolate, but to do so knowledgeably, we needed to create Trader Joe\u2019s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks. Made from 58.9% cocoa, a higher percentage than our chips, these chunks balance rich, dark chocolate with the perfect amount of sweetness. Unlike chips, these chunks are not formulated to hold their shape, so they melt more easily, thus covering more territory (in cookies, let\u2019s say). And because they are irregularly shaped, you can expect some \u201cchocolate debris\u201d from chunks, but significantly less than if you were to chop the chocolate yourself. In summary, Trader Joe\u2019s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks promise premium chocolate flavor, are easily prepared and measured, and melt smoothly & quickly, which makes them exceptional for baking and candy making. They are also sensational for snacking. You don\u2019t need to bake to enjoy great chocolate, after all.Made for us by an esteemed French-Belgian chocolate company that now produces product in North America, our Chocolate Chunks are of the same caliber that high-end bakeries and notable candy manufacturers use.

After the curdling, the whey is removed without pressing or aging resulting in a thick cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche-like cheese with a fat content upwards of 60%+.The final product is that of a smooth, thickened cream not far from the texture of whipped butter. This light texture continues with a mildly flavored, milky flavored cheese that is so mellow in flavor it can lend itself to both sweet and savory dishes.

After a brisk three to four minutes in boiling water, they take on a delightful al dente texture and can be served as simply (with a splash of olive oil and a pinch of crushed red pepper) or as sauce-fully (tossed with warm Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto, for instance) as you\u2019d like.", "sale_prices": 3.99, "prices": [3.99, 3.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20503/71761.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20503/71761.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20503/71761.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20503/71761.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/vegan-spinach-&-cashew-ravioli-071761", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "071761", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20503/71761.png", "size": 8.8, "unit": "Oz", "price": 3.99}]}, {"product_id": "073603", "title": "Crispy Crunchy Peanut Butter Cookies", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/73603.png", "price": 4.49, "currency": "USD", "description": "Trader Joe\u2019s Crispy Crunchy Peanut Butter Cookies are everything a cookie-craving, peanut-butter-loving person would appreciate.

Then, their head mezcalero, a third-generation mezcal distiller, ferments the nectar using traditional methods passed down through the decades.

And in a Trader Joe\u2019s Organic Corn Chip Dipper, at that \u2014 our original Dippers have been a Customer & Crew favorite for years. With a hint of chipotle, a kick of smoky heat, and a bit of buttermilk-y tang, these Chips have loads of flavor on their own, but they\u2019re perfect for plunging into guacamole or a chunky salsa. Or, for some extra-punchy nachos, try melting some shredded TJ\u2019s Unexpected Cheddar over them\u2026 \u00a1Que delicioso!", "sale_prices": 2.69, "prices": [2.69, 2.69], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/60564.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/60564.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/60564.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/60564.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/organic-elote-corn-chip-dippers-060564", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "060564", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/60564.png", "size": 9.75, "unit": "Oz", "price": 2.69}]}, {"product_id": "072929", "title": "Ranch \r\nSeasoning Blend", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20906/72929.png", "price": 2.99, "currency": "USD", "description": "Lend us your ears, oh lovers of Ranch!

An edible orb of sunshine, its bright yellow skin is mottled with natural russeting at the stem; the crisp flesh beneath boasts a sweet, tangy flavor and a seriously satisfying crunch.Enticingly sweet flavor and craveably crunchy texture aside, what\u2019s special about these precious pommes is their natural resistance to browning when cut. What that means for you is that you can cut them up and serve them in a salad\u2014no browning. You can slice them and add them to a lunchbox\u2014no browning. You can present wedges on a cheese tray\u2014no browning. This makes them almost as appealing when cut as they are when left whole.

In other words, this is a seriously hoppy IPA.We recommend drinking Boatswain Hazy IPA in a tall, frosted glass, paired up with spicy entr\u00e9es or snacks\u2014food that will hold its own next to this IPA\u2019s creamy bitterness, like a plate of our Spicy Buffalo Cheddar or TJ\u2019s Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings. The IPA may be Hazy, but one thing\u2019s crystal clear: if you\u2019re looking for something bold, citric, and hoppy, it\u2019s time to get on board with Boatswain Hazy IPA!", "sale_prices": 4.99, "prices": [4.99, 4.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/72565.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/72565.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/72565.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/72565.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/boatswain-hazy-ipa-172565", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "172565", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/72565.png", "size": 12, "unit": "Fl Oz", "price": 4.99}]}, {"product_id": "097926", "title": "Greek Yogurt with Honey", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20303/97926.png", "price": 5.49, "currency": "USD", "description": "Trader Joe's Greek Yogurt with Honey is smooth and creamy, super-rich, and an ideal balance of yogurt-y tartness and honey sweetness.

What, then, makes Trader Joe\u2019s Organic Roasted Seaweed with Sea Salt \u201corganic\u201d?Well, in farming conventional seaweed, farmers typically use food-grade acid to eliminate the presence of un- wanted species growing on the underwater crop. Instead of using these chemicals, however, the South Korean farmers who grow our Organic Seaweed use two natural methods to control pests. Seaweed is grown on ropes that are either attached to floating buoys, or to fixed poles in shallower tidal waters. When the buoys rotate, the seaweed is exposed to sunlight. Likewise, when the tide is low, the poles are \u201craised\u201d out of the water, allowing sunlight to reach the seaweed. In both cases, it\u2019s the exposure to sunlight that naturally controls the growth of unwanted species on the crop.Once harvested, this seaweed is roasted, cut, lightly misted with organic sunflower oil, & sprinkled with sea salt (the oil makes the salt stick.)

The fresh mozzarella\u2019s soft chewiness heightens the richness of the cream inside, which in turn is enhanced by the umami notes of the black summer truffle mixed within. It makes an excellent appetizer or side dish, especially when served with pasta or pizza, and even tastes amazing when melted directly onto of a wood-fired pizza, itself.

Or if your oven is full of turkey and stuffing, set the pie out on the counter at room temperature for 1-2 hours. Once defrosted, invert the pie onto your desired serving dish and remove the paper pan. Enjoy at room temperature or warm out of the oven, served on its own, with whipped cream, Vanilla Ice Cream or an ethereal dusting of Organic Powdered Sugar.", "sale_prices": 6.49, "prices": [6.49, 6.49], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20604/57622.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20604/57622.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20604/57622.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20604/57622.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/nantucket-style-cranberry-pie-057622", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "057622", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20604/57622.png", "size": 16.5, "unit": "Oz", "price": 6.49}]}, {"product_id": "068896", "title": "Holiday Vegetable Hash", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20501/68896.png", "price": 4.99, "currency": "USD", "description": "Looking for something to make Meatless Monday more exciting?

They're also just slightly larger than your standard tot, coming in at \r\naround one or two bites per Bite\u2014in other words, the perfect size for dunking in your favorite dipping sauce.\r\nAfter just a few minutes in either the air fryer, frying pan, or conventional oven, these vegan Bites develop a gloriously golden-brown exterior and crisp texture that goes especially well with ketchups, barbecue sauces, or even more adventurous choices like our Zhoug Sauce or Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto. And since they're vegan, they make a natural side for our Protein Patties, an excellent base for a vegan twist on a tot casserole, or an awesome anytime snack for kids and adults alike.

Few, though, can be traced back to the last ice age. Trader Joe\u2019s Cheddar & Gruyere M\u00e8lange, however, is so deeply rooted in the land, that the only way to completely understand it is to go back just that far. What is now northwestern Wisconsin was once barren land covered with glaciers.

So, when you think about it, it all goes back to the glaciers. People talk about terroir in relation to wines: this brief history is testimony to the fact that it can be just as appropriate in describing certain cheeses. The history of Cheddar & Gruyere M\u00e8lange at Trader Joe\u2019s isn\u2019t quite as ancient as the glaciers, but we have featured it in our cheese case for more than a decade.

Traditionally, the heartiness of rag\u00f9 alla bolognese comes from its base of slow-braised beef, pork, or veal, but by using a combination of perfectly-textured wheat protein and umami-rich mushrooms, our Vegan Pasta Bolognese evokes that typically non-vegan profile in a decidedly vegan way, all packaged together in one convenient, easy-to-prepare, frozen meal.\r\n\r\nEach bowl of Trader Joe\u2019s Vegan Pasta Bolognese comes with a bed of toothsome, tube-shaped pasta made from red lentils, which our supplier then tops with a ragu made with tomato, carrot, onion, and garlic, in addition to the previously mentioned mushrooms and wheat protein.

Perfectly ripe mangoes equal perfectly delicious bars. Of note, these bars have no sticks.

Simply add some grilled steak, chicken, or shrimp, and you have a full-fledged entr\u00e9e.

This robust rundown of redolent spices is combined with sugar to create the ideal base for a perfectly perfumed, satisfyingly sweet, and altogether tasty Spiced Chai latte.\r\n\r\nThis is where you come in: to create the creamiest Spiced Chai latte at home, simply mix two parts of your chosen base (milk or non-dairy beverage) with one part Black Tea Concentrate and give it a stir. That's it! No fussing with sweetener, no waiting for a proper steep-just pour, stir, and serve. If you're in need of an extra jolt, throw a shot of espresso in the mix to really shake things up.", "sale_prices": 2.79, "prices": [2.79, 2.79], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m304/62044.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m304/62044.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m304/62044.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m304/62044.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/spiced-chai-black-tea-concentrate-062044", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "062044", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m304/62044.png", "size": 16, "unit": "Fl Oz", "price": 2.79}]}, {"product_id": "062048", "title": "Pepita Salsa", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20403/62048.png", "price": 3.49, "currency": "USD", "description": "We're famously infatuated with pumpkin. You could call it our bread and butter. Honestly, you could go even farther and call it our Pumpkin Bread and Pumpkin Butter.\r\n\r\nBut we hope that in all the pumpkin craze, we don't overshadow one of the best parts of the pumpkin, the seed. Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, are an exceptionally crunchy, slightly nutty, deliciously flavorful treat that can bring a serious savory factor to pretty much anything they're added to, be it a pesto sauce, trail mix, or Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa.\r\n\r\nBy combining the bright, zesty tomato and pepper flavors of a traditional chunky salsa with the texture and nuttiness of finely chopped pepitas, our Pepita Salsa has created a savory synthesis of seed and spice. Not only do the pepitas add a nice thickness to the salsa's body, making it even easier to scoop up with a tortilla or corn chip, but their hearty, earthy flavor expertly balances the acidity of the tomatoes and vinegar.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, each bite of Pepita Salsa also carries the delicate sweet heat of pur\u00e9ed bell pepper and chipotle spices, making this one seriously satisfying salsa.\r\n\r\nPlease join us in welcoming Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa to our legendary family of pumpkin products. To celebrate, we recommend using it in any situation that calls for salsa, from a classic chips and salsa appetizer (especially with Trader Joe's Quinoa & Black Bean Infused Tortilla Chips), to a topping for jackfruit tacos, or as the sauce for homemade chilaquiles.", "sale_prices": 3.49, "prices": [3.49, 3.49], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20403/62048.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20403/62048.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20403/62048.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20403/62048.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/pepita-salsa-062048", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "062048", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20403/62048.png", "size": 12, "unit": "Oz", "price": 3.49}]}, {"product_id": "062070", "title": "Organic Shredded 3 Cheese Blend", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20201/62070.png", "price": 4.49, "currency": "USD", "description": "Some say three's a crowd.

While they're perfectly delicious when enjoyed as a quick, on-the-go breakfast snack or brunch side, we contend that they truly excel when heated up a bit in the toaster oven or microwave - the aromatics of warm blueberries alone are well worth the price of admission. After that, we recommend a generous application of butter, a drizzling of honey, or a sizeable spreading of Trader Joe's Authentic Lemon Curd.", "sale_prices": 4.99, "prices": [4.99, 4.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20105/64741.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20105/64741.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20105/64741.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20105/64741.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/blueberry-muffins-064741", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "064741", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20105/64741.png", "size": 14, "unit": "Oz", "price": 4.99}]}, {"product_id": "159714", "title": "Boatswain American I.P.A.", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/59714.png", "price": 4.99, "currency": "USD", "description": "Have we taken the nautical nomenclature too far?

Well, we did, and to be honest, sales weren't exactly spectacular.

Onto the Paratha itself!\r\n\r\nOne difference between the aforementioned Naan and Trader Joe's Malabari Paratha is in the ingredients. Our Malabari Paratha (made in the tradition of the Malabar region of Southern India) includes wheat flour, cow's & buffalo's milk, and a little bit of sugar & salt. In contrast, traditional Naan typically incorporates yogurt and yeast in its recipe.\r\n\r\nAnother difference is in the way these breads are formed. Our Paratha (like traditional Paratha) is formed by hand using a unique process in which thin rounds of dough are rolled into long ropes, which are then rolled into spirals that kind of look like cinnamon buns. Finally, they are pressed back into flattened rounds. (Paratha literally means \"layers of cooked flour.\")\r\n\r\nMore simply, Naan dough is flattened as it's slapped on the inside of the Tandoori oven to cook-which leads to the final difference: Trader Joe's Malabari Paratha is cooked on flat, griddle-like stoves.\r\n\r\nHeat our Malabari Paratha from frozen in a lightly oiled, non-stick pan until golden, and you'll find a bite that is crisp on the outside and soft & moist on the inside.

Well, Trader Joe's isn't planning on going on raids or building an empire (unless that empire is selling high-quality, delicious foods at low prices), but both have traveled the world trading goods, and... crispbread.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that crispbread can be traced back to the Vikings, who stored it on ships for long journeys across sea. They lived on spare diets in terms of crops and produce due to the cold weather, but crispbread was one food that brought them sustenance. Our buyers foraged (a more exciting way to say \"worked\") for months to get their hands on the perfect Trader Joe's Whole Grain Crispbread, and succeed they did.\r\n\r\nBut then we began to wonder... What about the gluten-intolerant Vikings? Surely they, too, would have enjoyed and benefited from a hearty Crispbread from time to time, right? Well, while we can't amend the past, we can enhance the present - with Trader Joe's Gluten Free Crispbread.\r\n\r\nYou may not be journeying for months on a knar (Viking merchant ship) anytime soon, but we think our made-in-Norway Gluten Free Crispbread will be an excellent addition to your everyday diet. Its ingredients include sunflower, sesame, and flax seeds; oat flakes; rice bran; potato fiber; and a few other straightforward additions, like salt and a touch of honey. With 4g of protein and 3g of fiber per cracker, a Viking could live off of these! They're mildly salty and totally seedy - with a coarse, crumbly, oh-so-gratifying crunch.\r\n\r\nYou can serve Gluten Free Crispbread alone, but you can also serve them as an appetizer with Trader Joe's Cream Cheese and Everything But The Bagel Seasoning, or as a dipping partner for a steaming bowl of Organic Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato Soup.", "sale_prices": 4.29, "prices": [4.29, 4.29], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/59721.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/59721.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/59721.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/59721.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/gluten-free-norwegian-crispbread-059721", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "059721", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m21001/59721.png", "size": 7.55, "unit": "Oz", "price": 4.29}]}, {"product_id": "061231", "title": "Organic Green Vegetable Foursome", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20603/61231.png", "price": 2.99, "currency": "USD", "description": "If two's company and three's a crowd, what does that make four?

And we could say, if we were prone to hyperbole and self-aggrandizement, that Trader Joe's has been instrumental in orchestrating that moment. What we will say, clearly, is that the early and exciting success of our Green Jackfruit in Brine led us to the realization that American palates have an appetite for jackfruit. And that realization led us to the creation of Trader Joe's Yellow Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice.\r\n\r\nJackfruit grows in abundance in Thailand, which is where our supplier is located. They've sourced green (unripe) jackfruit here; at this stage in the ripening process, the fruit cooks to a meat-like consistency and mild flavor that's ready to take on the flavor of any sauce.\r\n\r\nHere, we've paired it with a creamy, coconut milk-based yellow curry sauce, created in-house with a yellow curry paste rich in freshly ground herbs and spices including lemongrass, cumin, and turmeric. To release the fragrant aromatics, the curry paste is cooked over medium heat, then slowly simmered with coconut milk to create a rich, vibrantly flavored sauce. That sauce is the perfect partner to tender pieces of jackfruit and chunks of eggplant and red bell pepper.\r\n\r\nAnd what's a curry without rice? Incomplete, that's what. So we've included a sidecar of white jasmine rice; its fragrant aroma and slightly chewy texture make it the ideal carbohydrate companion for this easy to heat and enjoy entr\u00e9e.", "sale_prices": 2.99, "prices": [2.99, 2.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/59976.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/59976.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/59976.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/59976.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/yellow-jackfruit-curry-with-jasmine-rice-059976", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "059976", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/59976.png", "size": 13, "unit": "Oz", "price": 2.99}]}, {"product_id": "059139", "title": "Cauliflower Pizza Crusts", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/59139.png", "price": 3.99, "currency": "USD", "description": "There is no shortage of products available for the pizza appreciators shopping in our stores.

What we found with some of the restaurant versions was an abundance of batter, and pretty small shrimp. We're using large shrimp and a batter that lightly coats the shrimp, yet manages to retain its crunch even after it's been combined with the sauce. (Comparable restaurant versions are 40% batter; ours are 30% batter.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the sauce, it's a sweet, creamy concoction that's finished with a hint of pineapple to give the flavor a bright boost. And we couldn't have Honey Walnut Shrimp without walnuts, right? Every package contains candied walnuts you toss with the shrimp and sauce before serving. All of the components are packaged separately, and the bag has detailed instructions that will yield delicious results.\r\n\r\nIt's not at all complicated, really - saut\u00e9 or bake shrimp, toss with sauce, top with walnuts.

It\u2019s a staple component in French Bordeaux, but it typically takes a backseat to the other included varietals. Trader Joe\u2019s Petit Reserve Cabernet Franc Paso Robles contains some of those same Bordeaux components, only in this case, it\u2019s the Cab Franc that\u2019s driving the car.These grapes are grown in the Central Coast region of California, specifically in Paso Robles, which is known for its Bordeaux-style blends. Partnered with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and a couple other grape varietals, the Cab Franc really shines. The wine is vibrant and rich, with a full body, firm tannins, and plenty of acidity. It\u2019s dark ruby red in the glass, with black cherry and plum on the nose, and a smooth zest on the tongue that includes hints of mocha and toasty oak.", "sale_prices": 7.99, "prices": [7.99, 7.99], "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/74557.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/74557.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/74557.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640", "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/74557.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280"], "url": "https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/petit-reserve-cabernet-franc-paso-robles-2021-074557", "brand": "Trader Joe's", "models": [{"id": "074557", "image": "https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/74557.png", "size": 750, "unit": "mL", "price": 7.99}]}]
